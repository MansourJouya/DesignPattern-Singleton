# Design Patterns - Singleton

This repository contains implementations of the Singleton design pattern in various programming languages. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Introduction

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. In this repository, you will find implementations in C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, VB.NET, F#, and more.

### What is Singleton?

Singleton is a design pattern that falls under the category of **Creational Patterns**. Creational patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is commonly used when a single instance of a class is required to control access to shared resources, such as a configuration object or a database connection.

## Languages Included

- C#
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript
- VB.NET
- F#

Each language has its own directory containing the specific implementation of the Singleton pattern.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourJouya/DesignPatterns-Singleton.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPatterns-Singleton
```

You can then explore the implementation in your preferred programming language.

## Usage

1. Choose the language implementation you want to work with.
2. Follow the instructions in each language's directory for running the example code.
3. Observe how the Singleton pattern is applied and how it ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created.

### Example (C#)

In C#, the Singleton pattern is implemented in the `DatabaseConnection.cs` file. To run the example, ensure you have .NET installed and execute the following commands:

```bash
dotnet run
```
